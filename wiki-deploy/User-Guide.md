## Understanding the Agent System

### Agent Types

The system automatically routes your requests to the most appropriate specialized agent:

#### Personal Assistant Agent
- **Purpose**: Main coordinator and general assistance
- **Use for**: General questions, task coordination, conversation management
- **Example**: "What can you help me with today?"

#### Calendar Agent
- **Purpose**: Schedule and event management
- **Use for**: Creating events, checking availability, managing appointments
- **Examples**:
  - "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM"
  - "What do I have scheduled for next week?"
  - "Cancel my 3 PM appointment"

#### Search Agent  
- **Purpose**: Real-time web search and information retrieval
- **Use for**: Current information, research, fact-checking
- **Examples**:
  - "What's the latest news about AI developments?"
  - "Find information about renewable energy trends"
  - "Search for the best restaurants in downtown"

#### Code Assistant Agent
- **Purpose**: Programming help and code generation
- **Use for**: Writing code, debugging, explanations, technical guidance
- **Examples**:
  - "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers"
  - "Help me debug this JavaScript error"
  - "Explain how machine learning works"

### How Agent Selection Works

The system automatically analyzes your request and routes it to the appropriate agent based on:
- Keywords and context
- Request intent
- Required capabilities
- Conversation history

You don't need to specify which agent to use - the system handles this intelligently.

## Effective Communication Tips

### Be Specific and Clear

**Good**: "Schedule a team meeting for next Tuesday at 10 AM in Conference Room A to discuss the Q4 budget"

**Avoid**: "Set up a meeting"

### Provide Context

**Good**: "I'm working on a Python web scraping project and getting a 403 error when trying to access https://example.com"

**Avoid**: "My code doesn't work"

### Ask Follow-up Questions

The assistant maintains conversation context, so you can build on previous exchanges:

```
You: "What's the weather like in New York?"
Assistant: [Provides weather information]
You: "What about tomorrow?"
Assistant: [Provides tomorrow's forecast for New York]
```

### Use Natural Language

Write as you would speak to a colleague:
- "Can you help me find..."
- "I need to schedule..."
- "What's the best way to..."
